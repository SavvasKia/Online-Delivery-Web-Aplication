# System Design Documents

I want to use new technology so I will use React.js to create a single-page application. A web application that interacts with the user by dynamically rewriting the current web page. The goal is faster transitions that make the website feel more responsive.

For the back-end, I will use Node.js

The first step is to set local simple node.js server and start tutorial React.js
The next step is to build a template to use for the menu to load items from a json file.

Seconds step build html template and then integrate them in react with BroswerRouter. Responsiveness needs some work, but I will continue with
scripting to add the menu from json file and then build the cart.
